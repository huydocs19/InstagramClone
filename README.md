# Project 3 - *Instagram Clone*

**Instagram Clone** is a photo sharing app similar to Instagram but using Parse as its backend.

## User Stories
- User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication.
- User can log in and log out of his or her account.
- The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts.
- User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram".
- User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram".
- The user should switch between different tabs - viewing all posts (feed view), compose (capture photos form camera) and profile tabs (log out) using fragments and a Bottom Navigation View.
